## Idle game

### Description

Incremental click game (idle game). The goal is simple and unfolds
in several steps:
● When a user clicks, he earns points.
● The shop allows you to spend points to buy
items and bonuses.
The elements allow you to produce more points, manually (click) or automatically (idle). Bonuses improve these elements.
● Elements and bonuses cost more and more and produce more and more points or improve already existing elements.
The price scale makes the accession of points almost exponential. By
example, at the start of the game, each click is worth 1 point.
After 1 minute, using items and bonuses, each click earns 3, after 1 hour 1000, after 1 day 1,000,000.
In the event of a cut, the user keeps his progress thanks to the regular storage of the state of the game in the localStorage.
